# Get Started

1. Install the CodeCycle extension in your web browser. After the installation / If the submission is not tracked, pls try to restart your browser.
2. Solve and submit LeetCode problems. Upon successful submission, CodeCycle sets the next review time for the problem based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.
3. Open CodeCycle to view problems that need to be reviewed now, problems scheduled for future review and mastered problems. You can use the switch in the popup page to switch between the LeetCode global site and the LeetCode CN site.
4. Enjoy coding!

# Next Steps
